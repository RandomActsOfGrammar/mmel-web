  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Extensibella is an interactive proof assistant for proving
    properties about extensible languages built by
    independently-developed modules which may build on each other.
    Module writers prove properties for each module independently, as
    they were written, with a guarantee the proofs can be combined to
    form a proof for any composed language built by combining some
    number of modules.  These properties may be introduced by any
    module.
  </p>

  <p>
    Extensibella proves properties using induction and case analysis
    on judgments.  In some situations, depending on where the property
    is introduced relative to where the relevant judgment and
    syntactic category for the case analysis are introduced, the cases
    may be distributed across the modules so each module proves the
    cases it introduces.  However, there are some situations where a
    module must prove a property will hold for other modules it does
    not know.  In any situation, a proof in Extensibella guarantees
    the property will hold for any composed language.

  <h2>About the Name</h2>
  <p>
    Extensibella reasons about extensible languages
    using <a href="https://abella-prover.org">Abella</a> to check the
    validity of the logical reasoning apart from the restrictions
    specific to extensibility.  The name "Extensibella" is a
    combination of <b>extensib</b>le and A<b>bella</b>, where each
    word gave a little to make the combination work.
