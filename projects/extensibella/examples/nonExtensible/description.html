  <h1>Non-Extensible Reasoning</h1>
  <p>
    This example is not a language; rather it is a collection of a few
    relations on lists and some interesting properties about them.  It
    has one <a href="lists/lists.html">module</a>; there is no
    reason to have more modules, since there is nothing being
    extended.  This is based on a subset of the Sterling standard
    library; each relation here is a modified version of one of the
    Sterling standard library's relations.
