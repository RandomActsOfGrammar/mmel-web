  <h1>Modular Reasoning</h1>
  <p>
    In proving properties
    about <a href="extensibleLanguages.html">extensible languages</a>,
    each module may introduce its own properties, providing some
    portion of a proof for them, as well as providing some portion of
    the proof for properties from the modules it imports.
    Extensibella ensures the proof work provided by each module will
    work together so a full proof of each property can be built using
    this modular proof work without needing human intervention.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two pieces to ensuring the modular proof work will be
    valid for proving the property for any composed language:
    <ul>
      <li> Each proof command must have the same effects in the
        context of the composed language as in the context of the
        module in which it was written.
      <li> All cases in the composed language must be proven by some
        proof work written in the context of one of the modules.
    </ul>
    We will discuss both below.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Ensuring Proof Commands Remain Valid</h2>
  <p>
    We want the proof fragments written in the context of a single
    module and the modules on which it builds to remain valid in the
    composed language, meaning it proves the same sequents.  The
    difference between the two contexts is that the latter's language
    may include more language constructs, relations, and rules for
    existing relations, as well as that we might have more properties
    we may use as lemmas in the composition.  Then the only actions we
    might take in a proof that could have different effects in the
    composed language are those that rely on the language
    specification.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using a rule to prove something (e.g. using a typing rule for
    addition to find an addition has an integer type) is not affected
    by the composition, as all rules included in the context of a
    module are also included in a composition using it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only proof operation that might change is a case analysis on a
    derivation of a relation.  Since more rules may exist in a
    composed language than in the context of a module, a naive case
    analysis may create more cases in the context of a composed
    language than in the context of a module and its imports.  This
    would be a problem, as the extra cases would not have proofs to
    handle them, and the composed language would not have a full
    proof.
  </p>

  <p>
    To ensure this does not happen, we restrict case analysis within
    the proofs written for modules.  Specifically, we restrict it to
    analyze only derivations where the primary component of the
    relation derived is built by a known constructor.  Recall
    from <a href="extensibleLanguages.html">our discussion of
    extensible languages</a> that new rules written for an imported
    relation in a module must have the primary component built by new
    syntax constructors also from that module.  This prevents new
    rules from being added in further extension modules that will
    apply to known syntax, and thus we know, in the context of a
    module and its imports, all the cases that might apply in such a
    case even when we move to the context of a composed language.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>All Cases Proven</h2>
  <p>
    In Extensibella, language properties are proven arguing by
    induction and case analysis on the derivation of a relation.  The
    cases arising from this case analysis are distributed across the
    modules that know the property, with how they are distributed
    depending on the relation between the modules introducing the
    property, the relation on which it carries out its top-level case
    analysis, and the primary component of this relation.
  </p>

  <h3>All Introduced Together</h3>
  <p>
    If the property, relation, and its primary component are all
    introduced by the same module, each module introducing a new
    constructor of the primary component will also introduce the rules
    defining the relation for it.  Additionally, each module will know
    the property exists.  Then we can distribute the proof work across
    all the modules knowing the relation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each module is responsible for providing modular proof fragments
    showing the property holds in the cases arising from the rules it
    introduces.  Since each case in the language composition arises
    from a rule that is given by one of the modules, and the module
    giving it must have provided a modular proof fragment showing the
    property holds in that case, each case is proven in the composed
    language.
  </p>

  <h3>Property and Relation Introduced Together</h3>
  <p>
    If the property and relation are introduced in the same module but
    the relation's primary component is introduced in an imported
    module, other modules may add constructors of the primary
    component where the relation is defined by the default rule
    introduced by the module introducing the relation and the
    property.  Additionally, other modules may build on the one
    introducing the relation and property, adding new constructors of
    the primary component and rules for the relation for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this situation, a subset of the cases will be known by modules
    knowing the property, those for rules introduced in the module
    introducing the property, as well as those in modules that build
    on the one introducing the property.  The module introducing the
    property writes proof fragments for the rules it knows, with the
    cases for modules building on it having proof fragments written by
    those modules.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cases for constructors introduced by other modules are grouped
    together as a single proof case for the module introducing the
    property to prove, called <em>preservability</em>.  The idea is to
    show the property holds for any constructor of the primary
    component introduced by another module that does not know the
    relation.  In this case, the relation is defined for the unknown
    constructors by the default rule.  We handle this in Extensibella
    by a special <code>&lt;unknown ty&gt;</code> constructor for
    type <code>ty</code> where the relation is explicitly defined by
    the default rule.  This proof fragment can then be used for each
    instantiation of the default rule in the composition.
  </p>

  <h3>Relation and Primary Component Introduced Together</h3>
  <p>
    If the relation and its primary component are introduced together
    but the property is introduced in a module building on that one,
    each module introducing a new constructor of the primary component
    will also introduce the rules defining the relation for it.
    However, not every module will know the property exists, so we
    cannot distribute the proof work across all the module knowing the
    relation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this situation, a subset of the cases will be known by modules
    knowing the property, those for rules introduced in the module
    introducing the property and any modules it imports, as well as
    those in modules that build on the one introducing the property.
    The module introducing the property writes proof fragments for
    the rules it knows, with the cases for modules building on it
    having proof fragments written by those modules.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cases for rules introduced by other modules are grouped into a
    preservability proof case for the module introducing the property
    to prove as before, using the <code>&lt;unknown ty&gt;</code>
    constructor.  However, the rules for the unknown cases are each
    introduced by the other modules, and are thus unknown to the
    module introducing the property.  The module introducing the
    relation must have given a special property, introduced in
    Extensibella by <code>Ext_Ind</code>, showing what can be expected
    of a rule introduced by another extension.  This gives a rule
    for <code>&lt;unknown ty&gt;</code> using this behavior.  The
    preservability proof fragment proves the property holds for this
    rule, and the <code>Ext_Ind</code> property will allow us to lift
    this to any actual rule in the composition.
  </p>

  <h3>All Introduced Separately</h3>
  <p>
    If each was introduced in a separate module, there can be
    constructors of the primary component where the relation is not
    known, so the default rule is used to define it for them.
    Additionally, there can be rules written for the relation in
    modules where the property is not known.
  </p>

  <p>
    As with the previous two cases, some of the rules are known in
    modules where the property is known, and these can be proven in
    the same way.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, we also have unknown cases, but now there are two types
    of cases in the composition that are unknown in the module
    introducing the property:
    <ul>
      <li> Some cases are for instantiations of the default rule for
        the relation, for constructors introduced by module that don't
        know the relation
      <li> Some cases are for rules written by modules that know the
        relation but not the property
    </ul>
    These require a combination of the approaches for the two previous
    situations.  We have two preservability proofs, one for the
    default rule and one for the other cases
    using <code>Ext_Ind</code>.  The appropriate preservability proof
    can then be used for each unknown case in the composition.
  </p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Fixed Properties</h2>
  <p>
    Extensibella also introduces the concept of <em>fixed
    properties</em>.  Unlike extensible properties, introduced
    by <code>Extensible_Theorem</code> and discussed above, fixed
    properties do not have cases from a top-level case analysis to
    distribute.  Instead the full proof will be given by the module
    introducing the property.  The restrictions on case analysis from
    above are still enforced, preventing new cases from being added to
    the proof in the composition.
