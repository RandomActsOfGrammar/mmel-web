  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Sterling is a system for specifying extensible languages built by
    independently-developed modules.  Modules may introduce syntactic
    categories and constructors for them, as well as judgments and
    inference rules defining them.  Extensions to a module can add new
    constructors to existing syntactic categories and new rules
    defining existing judgments, as well as introducing its own
    syntactic categories and judgments.  The normal arrangement of
    modules is a single host language module with extensions adding to
    it.  A composed language may be built from any number of modules
    by combining the separate specifications.
  </p>

  <p>
    When extensions introduce judgments over syntactic categories
    given by modules on which they build, they cannot introduce rules
    directly for syntax constructors given by other extensions because
    the other extensions are unknown to the extension introducing the
    judgment.  Sterling handles this by having the extension
    introducing a relation define a default rule that will be
    instantiated for constructors from other extensions in the
    language composition.  This rule may use a translation, defined by
    the extension introducing a constructor, to define the new
    relation; this is similar
    to <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45937-5_11">forwarding
    in attribute grammars</a>.

  <h2>About the Name</h2>
  <p>
    Sterling is implemented
    in <a href="https://melt.cs.umn.edu/silver/">Silver</a>, a system
    for writing extensible languages using attribute grammars.  The
    name "Sterling" is a play on "Silver", as in sterling silver.
    Sterling silver is also why the logo is a silver spoon.
