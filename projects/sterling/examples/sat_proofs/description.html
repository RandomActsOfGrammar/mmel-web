  <h1>SAT Proofs</h1>
  <p>
    SAT solvers determine whether formulas in conjunctive normal form
    are satisfiable or not.  If a formula is satisfiable, the solver
    outputs a satisfying assignment, which can then be checked against
    the original formula.  If a formula is not satisfiable, the solver
    can write a proof demonstrating that fact, again giving an
    independent way to check the solver's solution is correct.  This
    language describes some such proof languages.

  <ul>
    <li> <a href="lrat/lrat.html">LRAT proof format</a>:
      The <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-63046-5_14">LRAT
        proof format</a> is our host language on which the other
      extensions build, defining what it means for a formula to be
      satisfiable, the proof format, and a check for a given proof
      being valid.  Strictly speaking, this only implements the RUP
      subset of the LRAT format; adding the RAT portion is not
      extensibly interesting.
    <li> <a href="drat/drat.html">DRAT extension</a>:
      The <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-09284-3_31">DRAT
        proof format</a> is the current standard for unsatisfiability
      proofs, which does not contain proof hints like LRAT does.  This
      extension adds an extraction of LRAT proofs to DRAT proofs and a
      check for a DRAT proof being valid.  As before, this only
      implements the RUP subset of the DRAT format.
    <li> <a href="clauses/clauses.html">Clauses extension</a>:  This
      extension adds a new clause constructor to represent certain
      clauses more efficiently.
    <li> <a href="frat/frat.html">FRAT extension</a>:
      The <a href="https://lmcs.episciences.org/9357/">FRAT proof
        format</a> combines the efficiency of checking (in standard
      tools) of LRAT with the efficiency of generating proofs of DRAT.
      This extension covers the RUP portion of FRAT and defines both
      checking of the initial proof and elaboration to an LRAT proof
      containing only the necessary portion of the clauses for
      checking the proof is valid.
