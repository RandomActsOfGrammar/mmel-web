  <h1>Reference Guide</h1>
  <p>
    Extensibella is an interactive proof assistant based
    on <a href="https://abella-prover.org">Abella</a>.  Much of the
    language will look familiar to those familiar with Abella.

<div class="section" id="syntax">
  <h2>Syntax</h2>
  <p>
    The syntax of formulas in Extensibella includes the following
    constructs:
    <table class="syntax-table display-syntax-table">
      <tr>
        <td><code>forall A B C, ...</code></td>
        <td>universal quantification</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>exists A B C, ...</code></td>
        <td>existential quantification</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>F1 /\ F2<code></td>
        <td>and</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>F1 \/ F2</code></td>
        <td>or</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>F1 -> F2</code></td>
        <td>implies</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>true</code></td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>false</code></td>
        <td>false</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>t1 = t2</code></td>
        <td>equality</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>t1, t2, t3 |{ty}- t ~~> t'</code></td>
        <td>translation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>rel t1 t2 t3</code></td>
        <td>relation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;rel {ES}&gt; t1 t2 t3</code></td>
        <td>extension size of a derivation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;rel {T}&gt; t1 t2 t3</code></td>
        <td>translation version of a relation</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Additionally, we have infix binary operations for several types
    (e.g. <code>t1 + t2 = t3</code>):
    <table class="syntax-table"
           <tr>
             <td>Integers:</td>
             <td><code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>,
               <code>/</code>, <code>mod</code>, <code>&lt;</code>,
               <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
               <code>&gt;=</code></td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td>Booleans:</td>
             <td><code>&&</code>, <code>||</code></td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td>Lists and Strings:</td>
             <td><code>++</code></td>
           </tr>
    </table>
    We also have unary integer negation (<code>- t1 = t2</code>) and
    unary Boolean negation (<code>!t1 = t2</code>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The syntax of terms in Extensibella includes the following
    constructs:
    <table class="syntax-table display-syntax-table">
      <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;var&gt;</code></td>
        <td>variable</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>c t1 t2 t3</code></td>
        <td>constructor application</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>t1::t2</code></td>
        <td>cons list</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>nil</code></td>
        <td>empty list</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[]</code></td>
        <td>empty list</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[t1, t2, t3]</code></td>
        <td>list literal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>(t1, t2, t3)</code></td>
        <td>tuple literal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>"string"</code></td>
        <td>string literal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>&lt;integer&gt;</code></td>
        <td>integer literal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>true</code></td>
        <td>Boolean true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>false</code></td>
        <td>Boolean false</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </p>

  <p>
    Identifiers (variables, theorem names, relations, etc.) may begin
    with a letter or one of <code>-^=`&#39;?</code> followed by any
    letters, digits, symbols from the previous list,
    or <code>_*@+#!~/</code>.  Note that this also means spaces in
    operations can be important.  For example, <code>a + b = c</code>
    is an integer addition formula, but <code>a+b=c</code> is a single
    identifier.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anywhere the short name of a construct can be used, the qualified
    name can also be used.  For example, if
    module <code>mo:du:le</code> contains a relation <code>rel</code>,
    both <code>rel x y z</code> and <code>mo:du:le:rel x y z</code>
    may be used interchangeably, as long as there is not another
    relation named <code>rel</code> available in the current module.
  </p>

  <p>
    Single-line comments start with <code>%</code> and may begin
    anywhere in a line.  Multi-line comments are demarcated
    by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="moduleDecl">
  <h2>Module Declaration</h2>
  <p>
    Each Extensibella interaction begins with a module declaration:
    <pre class="code extensibella">Module mo:du:le.</pre>
    This tells Extensibella which language specification to use,
    namely the one for the module named <code>mo:du:le</code>.  This
    is the language module about which the session will reason.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="topCommands">
  <h2>Top-Level Commands</h2>
  <p>
    Top-level commands are commands that may be used outside of a
    proof.
  </p>

  <h3>Basic Top-Level Commands</h3>
  We take our basic top-level commands
  from <a href="https://abella-prover.org">Abella</a>:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Theorem &lt;name&gt; : &lt;formula&gt;.</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>Declares a (non-extensible) theorem, causing
          Extensibella to enter its proof mode for the user to prove
          it</blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>Define &lt;pred&gt; : &lt;type&gt;,
          &lt;pred&gt; : &lt;type&gt;, ... by

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>Inductively defines a set of non-extensible
          fixed-point relations at the proof level</blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>Split &lt;name&gt; as
          &lt;name&gt;, ... &lt;name&gt;.</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>Splits a theorem with top-level conjunctions
          into separate theorems.  For example, <code>Split thm as a,
          b, c.</code> where <code>thm</code> refers to the
          formula <code>f1 /\ f2 /\ f3</code> will create three new
          theorems, <code>f1</code>
          named <code>a</code>, <code>f2</code> named <code>b</code>,
          and <code>f3</code> named <code>c</code>.</blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>Declares a new proof-level constructor with the
          given type.  The type must be a proof-level type, not a type
          in the language or a built-in type.</blockquote></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Extensible Declarations</h3>
  Extensibella has top-level commands for declaring extensible proof
  objects:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Extensible_Theorem &lt;name&gt; :
          forall &lt;bindings&gt;,
          &lt;hyp name&gt; : &lt;formula&gt; -&gt;

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>Declares an extensible to be proven, using
          induction and case analysis on the premise given in

          primary component</blockquote></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>Multiple extensible theorems can be declared

          each theorem</blockquote></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>Non-extensible theorems may be added, for
          purposes of mutual induction, after all extensible theorems
          in a group with the <code>also</code> keyword, repeating
          the theorem declaration part after the <code>also</code>
          keyword.  The <code>also</code> keyword needs only be given
          once, with each non-extensible theorem comma-separated
          after it</blockquote></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>The inductive hypothesis may be given a
          descriptive name by adding <code>as &lt;IH name&gt;</code>
          after the <code>on</code> clause of a theorem

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code><code>Translation_Constraint &lt;name&gt; :

            &lt;original&gt; ~~&gt; &lt;translation&gt; -&gt;

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>This also introduces three lemmas the user does
          not need to prove but can use.  For a

            <li> <code>ext_ind_is_int_rel</code>, that the extension
              size has the <code>is_integer</code> relation hold for
              it
            <li> <code>ext_ind_pos_rel</code>, that the extension size
              is greater than or equal to zero
            <li> <code>drop_ext_ind_rel</code>, that the extension
              size version of the relation is equivalent to the
              relation itself
          </ul>
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  Each of these extensible top-level commands also has
  a <code>Prove</code> version, used for adding to its proof in
  modules that build on the module introducing it.  They
  are <code>Prove_Theorem</code>, <code>Prove_Constraint</code>,
  and <code>Prove_Ext_Ind</code>, respectively.  Each of these takes a
  list of qualified names (<emph>note</emph> short names) for the
  theorems, or, in the last case, relations, for the proofs to which
  it is adding, and presents the user with the new cases to prove in
  the current module.
</div>

<div class="section" id="tactics">
  <h2>Tactics</h2>
  <p>
    Tactics are the commands used within a proof to advance the proof
    state.  We borrow our tactics
    from <a href="https://abella-prover.org">Abella</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Abella Tactics</h3>
  Several tactics operate in the same way in Extensibella as in
  Abella:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>induction on &lt;num&gt;.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          For a goal of the form <code>forall A B C, H1 -> H2 -> H3 ->
          G</code>, the induction tactic permits induction on one
          of <code>H1</code>, <code>H2</code>, and <code>H3</code>
          (e.g. <code>induction on 2</code> for <code>H2</code>).
          Mutual induction across a conjunction can be declared with
          multiple numbers.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>intros &lt;names&gt;.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          For a goal of the form <code>forall A B C, H1 -> H2 -> H3 ->
          G</code>, the <code>intros</code> tactic introduces new
          eigenvariables <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>,
          and <code>C</code> and new
          hypotheses <code>H1</code>, <code>H2</code>,
          and <code>H3</code>.  Giving names to the tactic gives those
          names to the introduced hypotheses.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>apply &lt;thm&gt; to &lt;hyps&gt; with &lt;var&gt; =
      &lt;tm&gt;, ....</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Applies a formula, referenced by name, to the given
          hypotheses, giving specific instantiations of the variables
          listed at the end, adding the conclusion to the context as a
          hypothesis.  The hypotheses to which it is applied may also
          include underscores, in which case Extensibella searches for
          a formula to fill them.  Any not found are added as subgoals
          for the user to prove.  Variable instantiations are usually
          not needed and may be left off; they are helpful in
          conjunction with underscores to fill in terms that are
          otherwise not known.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>backchain &lt;thm&gt; with &lt;var&gt; = &lt;tm&gt;, ....</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Unifies the conclusion of the formula with the current goal
          and searches for solutions to the premises.  If premises are
          not found, they are added as subgoals for the user to prove.
          As with applications, variable instantiations are optional,
          but are helpful if some of the bound variables in the
          formula do not appear in its conclusion.  This is similar
          to <code>apply</code> but works backward instead of forward.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>assert &lt;formula&gt;.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Extensibella searches for a proof of the formula; if one is
          not found, the formula is added as a subgoal for the user to
          prove.  Once the formula is proven, it is added to the
          context as a hypothesis.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>exists &lt;tm&gt;.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>search &lt;depth&gt;.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Searches for a way to prove the current goal, using rules to
          the given depth.  If no depth is given, this uses the
          default depth.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>split.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          For a goal of the form <code>A /\ B</code>, splits it into
          separate subgoals <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.

    </tr>

    <tr>

          prove <code>B</code>.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Restricted Tactics</h3>
  Some tactics have specific restrictions not seen in Abella that are
  necessary because we are reasoning in an extensible setting:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>case &lt;hyp&gt;.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Analyze the ways in which the formula in the hypothesis
          named <code>&lt;hyp&gt;</code> might have been derived.
          If <code>&lt;hyp&gt;</code> is not built by a relation or
          the relation is not an extensible relation, case analysis
          has no extra restrictions.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          If <code>&lt;hyp&gt;</code> has the form <code>rel t1
          ... tn</code> and <code>rel</code> is an extensible relation
          in the language, then case analysis is allowed if its
          primary component is built by a known constructor or its
          primary component is the explicit unknown constructor
          and <code>rel</code> is introduced by the current extension.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>unfold.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          For a goal of the form <code>rel t1 ... tn</code>, if there
          is only one rule for the goal that could prove it, replaces
          the goal with the body of the rule.  If <code>rel</code> is
          an extensible relation, its primary component must be built
          by a known constructor, not a variable on the explicit
          unknown constructor.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Proof State Manipulation Tactics</h3>
  There are also tactics that don't move the proof forward, but may be
  useful while working:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>skip.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Skips the current subgoal, moving to the next one.  This
          treats the subgoal as if it were truly solved.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>abort.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Aborts the current theorem without adding it to the set of
          known theorems.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>undo</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
         Undoes the effect of the last tactic. 
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>clear &lt;hyp&gt;.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Removes the given hypothesis from the context.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>rename &lt;name&gt; to &lt;name&gt;.</code><td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><blockquote>
          Changes the name of one hypothesis or variable to another.
      </blockquote></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<div class="section" id="typing">
  <h2>Typing</h2>
  All terms and formulas in Extensibella must be well-typed.
  Extensibella includes several built-in types:
  <ul>
    <li> <code>integer</code>
    <li> <code>string</code>
    <li> <code>bool</code>
    <li> <code>list</code> (kind <code>type -> type</code>,
      written <code>list A</code>)
    <li> <code>pair</code> (kind <code>type -> type -> type</code>,
    written <code>pair A B</code>)
  </ul>

  <p>
    Definitions and non-extensible theorems may be defined as
    polymorphic.  For definitions, any capitalized names in the
    definition will be treated as variables.  For example,
    <pre class="code extensibella">Define rel : A -> list (pair A B) -> prop by ...</pre>
    will define a relation with two variables, <code>A</code>
    and <code>B</code>.  Non-extensible theorems must declare their
    type variables.  For example,
    <pre class="code extensibella">Theorem thm[A, B] : forall (L : pair A B) X Y, ...</pre>
    Some bound variables need to be annotated with types so
    Extensibella can determine the correct types.
  </p>

  <p>
    Extensibella differentiates between language-level types and
    proof-level types in defining new constructors with
    the <code>Type</code> top-level command, but does not
    differentiate between them in typing.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="inductive-restrictions">
  <h2>Inductive Restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    As in Abella, the application of inductive hypotheses in
    Extensibella is guarded by inductive restrictions.  These
    are <code>*</code> for smaller and <code>@</code> for equal.
    The <code>induction</code> tactic adds the <code>@</code>
    restriction to the induction measure premise and creates the
    inductive hypothesis with the <code>*</code> restriction.  For
    example, <code>induction on 1</code> with
    <pre class="code extensibella">
============================
 forall A B C, rel A B -> rel B C -> rel A C </pre>
    as the proof state creates
    <pre class="code extensibella">
IH : forall A B C, rel A B * -> rel B C -> rel A C
============================
 forall A B C, rel A B @ -> rel B C -> rel A C </pre>
    The inductive hypothesis having the <code>*</code> restriction
    means it can only be used with an argument that also has
    the <code>*</code> restriction.  Such a hypothesis can be obtained
    by case analysis on a premise with the <code>@</code> restriction,
    meaning it is equal to the current derivation size we are
    attempting to prove.
  </p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Running Extensibella</h2>
  <p>
    Extensibella can be run interactively to build proofs.  The best
    way to do this is using <a href="#emacs">Proof General</a>, where
    one writes commands into a file in Emacs and runs them as they are
    written.  Alternatively, proofs may be written directly into
    Extensibella by running it as
    <pre class="code">
extensibella</pre>
    <b>Note this will not save the proofs written.</b>  Writing proofs
    directly into the Extensibella command line also requires saving
    the commands elsewhere.  When running interactively, Extensibella
    waits for a command, processes it, and displays the proof state
    after the command has run.
  </p>

  <p>
    To check an Extensibella file <code>thms.xthm</code> that has
    already been written, run
    <pre class="code">
extensibella --check thms.xthm</pre>
    This will check all the proofs are correct, and that all proof
    obligations have been fulfilled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because the Extensibella file for a module may be anywhere, a file
    must be compiled before proofs can be written for modules building
    on it.  This takes the relevant information modules building on it
    must know and places it in Extensibella's <code>generated</code>
    directory.  To compile a file <code>thms.xthm</code>, run
    <pre class="code">
extensibella --compile thms.xthm</pre>
    The best practice is to combine this with the <code>--check</code>
    flag, as the proofs being compiled are not checked by default, to
    ensure the properties being compiled are true.
    Note <code>--compile</code> by itself can be quite a bit faster
    than combining it with <code>--check</code>, however, which is why
    the combination is not the default.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to its use in writing modular proofs, Extensibella
    also provides a facility for combining them into a single Abella
    proof.  The existence of modular proofs acceptable to Extensibella
    is sufficient evidence a single Abella proof of the properties for
    the language exists, but this allows skeptics, or the curious, to
    check the proof for themselves.  To compose a set of modular
    proofs for the language of a module <code>mo:du:le</code> into an
    Abella proof <code>out.thm</code>, run
    <pre class="code">
extensibella --compose out.thm mo:du:le file_1.xthm file_2.xthm ... file_n.xthm</pre>
    where the listed files are the proof files for all modules
    included in the composition.  A few notes:
    <ul>
      <li> Each module file included in the composition must be able
        to be checked, so the specification of each module must be
        compiled for Extensibella and the proofs of all properties in
        the modules completed.
      <li> The module defining the language being composed,
        module <code>mo:du:le</code> in our example command, must be
        compiled for an Extensibella full language; this has slightly
        different requirements than the modular compiled format, so
        both will be needed.
      <li> If you are
        using <a href="../sterling/index.html">Sterling</a> for your
        language specifications, the list of proof files must include
        the one for the Sterling standard library as well.
    </ul>

<div class="section" id="emacs">
  <h2>Emacs Support</h2>
  <p>
    Extensibella has a mode written for Proof General, found in the
    <a href="https://github.com/RandomActsOfGrammar/extensibella/tree/master/editor/emacs">Extensibella
    GitHub repository</a>.  The mode has only been tested with
    the <a href="https://github.com/abella-prover/PG">Abella fork of
    Proof General</a> and is not guaranteed to work with other
    versions.
  </p>

  <p>
    To install the Extensibella Proof General instance, copy the
    <a href="https://github.com/RandomActsOfGrammar/extensibella/tree/master/editor/emacs">Extensibella
    Proof General files</a> to a directory
    named <code>Extensibella</code> in the Proof General directory.
    You also need to add the following line to
    the <code>generic/proof-site.el</code> file in the Proof General
    directory, in the <code>proof-assistant-table-default</code>:
    <pre class="code">
(extensibella "Extensibella" "xthm")</pre>
    This makes Proof General and Emacs know to open
    Extensibella <code>.xthm</code> files using this mode
    automatically.
