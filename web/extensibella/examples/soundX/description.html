  <h1>Modeling SoundX</h1>
  <p>
    SoundX, introduced in
    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2837614.2837644">"Sound
    type-dependent syntactic language extension"</a>, uses a model of
    language extension where extension modules build on a host
    language, defining new typing rules and rule for desugaring new
    syntax.  Evaluation is defined only for the host language.
    Programs are type checked using the extended language, but then
    desugared before being evaluated.
  </p>
  <p>
    SoundX has one property, that if a term <code>t</code> with
    type <code>ty</code> desugars to <code>t'</code>,
    then <code>t'</code> has type <code>ty'</code>,
    where <code>ty</code> desugars to <code>ty'</code>.  This property
    is proven automatically by the SoundX system.  Because the
    desugared program is the version that is run and we know it is
    well-typed, we then get the benefits of typing, such as type
    preservation and progress, from a proof for the host language
    alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, we emulate SoundX by defining typing over
    extensions, but evaluation only over the host language.  SoundX's
    property is proven by each extension
    (<code>desugar_ty_rel</code>), along with some other properties of
    typing.  The host language proves properties about evaluation for
    itself alone.  Unlike in SoundX, the proof of SoundX's property is
    not automatic.  However, also unlike SoundX, Extensibella can
    support extending the definitions of more relations than typing.
    Compare the language here
    to our <a href="../stlc/description.html">other version of the
      language</a> where we define evaluation and substitution for the
    extensions as well, and prove the properties of evaluation for
    them directly instead of through desugaring.
