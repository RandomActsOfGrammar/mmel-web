  <h1>Imperative Language with Loose Constraints</h1>
  <p>
    This host language defines a large imperative language defining
    programs as lists of functions, with one function being designated
    as the main function.  It defines typing and evaluation, with the
    latter defined as executing the main function, producing a list of
    values as printed output.
  </p>
  <p>
    The host language here introduces very loose projection
    constraints for evaluation, allowing extensions a lot of freedom
    in defining the semantics of their new constructs.  Together with
    the examples of <a href="../matchEval/description.html">evaluation
      through matching</a>
    and <a href="../exactEval/description.html">strict constraints on
      evaluation</a>, which both implement roughly the same underlying
    language with differing projection constraints, it allows us to
    explore how differences in projection constraints and constructs
    included in the host language affect what we can introduce and
    prove for extensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this version of the language, we find we can introduce a lot of
    constructs with natural definitions of their semantics.  However,
    as a tradeoff for this freedom, we find we cannot prove much about
    evaluation in extensions, as we see in
    the <a href="translation/translation.html">translation
      extension</a>.
