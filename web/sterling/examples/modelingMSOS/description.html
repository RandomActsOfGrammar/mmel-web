  <h1>Modeling Modular Structural Operational Semantics</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156783260400027X">Modular
      Structural operational semantics (MSOS)</a> is a way of writing
    language specifications using inference rules.  The modularity
    focus in MSOS is on reusing inference rules when new effects are
    added to a language.  In traditional SOS, if we define evaluation
    for an arithmetic language, we need to rewrite the rules to
    include an environment if we want to add variables.  MSOS gives us
    a formal way to reuse the rules from the arithmetic language
    without modification.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this example, we examine whether we can model in Sterling the
    same addition of effects to evaluation without modifying rules.
    We do this by threading around a context to which we may add new
    types of elements for new effects, such as an environment for a
    language including variables.  Our language is based on the one in
    the
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156783260400027X">MSOS
      paper</a>.  However, in the interests of examining different
    types of additions, we pare the host language back farther than
    in the paper, moving Booleans and constant declarations into
    extensions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="host/host.html">Host language</a>:  Arithmetic
      expressions and sequence command
    <li><a href="vars/vars.html">Vars extension</a>:  New syntax for
      let bindings and names in expressions and constant declarations
      commands; adds an environment to the context
    <li><a href="stores/stores.html">Stores extension</a>:  New
      syntax for variables acting as pointers to memory locations
      building on the vars extension; adds a store of memory locations
      for changeable variables
    <li><a href="bool/bool.html">Boolean extension</a>:  New syntax
      for true and false expressions and conditional and while-loop
      commands
    <li><a href="print/print.html">Print extension</a>:  New syntax
      for print commands; adds a list of printed values to the context
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are some parts of MSOS extensibility we cannot mimic.
    Because its modularity is focused on adding effects to existing
    evaluation relations, not on adding new syntax or semantic
    relations, it allows extensions to write new rules for evaluating
    existing constructs.  In the paper language, this is used for
    adding errors in evaluation as a modular effect, defining error
    evaluation as part of an extension for host-language-introduced
    arithmetic expressions.  Because of Sterling's focus on adding new
    syntax and semantic relations in extensions and ensuring the
    composed semantics are reasonable, we do not allow the
    introduction of such rules and thus cannot completely model MSOS.
