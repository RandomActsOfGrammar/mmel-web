  <h1>Tutorial</h1>
  <p>
    This tutorial introduces developing an extensible language in
    Sterling.  It builds an example with a host language and a few
    extensions.  Note this only covers the semantic portion of the
    language, describing abstract syntax and language semantics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sterling languages are built by modules.  These modules build on
    each other, adding to the definitions given by the modules on
    which they build.  Because extensions to a module are written
    separately, they may introduce the same name for different uses.
    To avoid confusion, each name introduced in a module is qualified
    with the module's name.  For example,
    our <code>tutorial:host</code> module introduces a constructor
    with the short name <code>var</code>.  The full name of this
    constructor is <code>tutorial:host:var</code>.  Either the full
    name or the short name may be used generally.  However, if two
    constructs with the same name are in the module, perhaps from two
    separate built-on modules, the full name must be used to
    differentiate them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modules in Sterling are defined as collections of files in a
    single directory.  Modules are named after their directories, so
    the <code>tutorial:host</code> module would be a collection of
    files in a directory named <code>host</code> inside a directory
    named <code>tutorial</code> (<code>tutorial/host</code>).  When we
    run Sterling and tell it to process the <code>tutorial:host</code>
    module, it looks for this directory structure to identify the
    files belonging to the module.
  </p>

  <p>
    The language we build here has four modules:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="#host">Host language</a>
        (<code>tutorial:host</code>)
      <li> <a href="#letExtension">Extension adding <code>let</code>
          bindings</a> (<code>tutorial:let</code>)
      <li> <a href="#typingExtension">Extension adding typing</a>
        (<code>tutorial:typing</code>)
      <li> <a href="#numExtension">Extension adding numbers</a>
        (<code>tutorial:num</code>)
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="host">
  <h2>Host Language</h2>
  <p>
    Languages in Sterling start with a host language, a module on
    which all others build.  Our host language will be the untyped
    lambda calculus.
  </p>

  <p>
    We start each file in a module with a declaration of which module
    we are defining.  In our case, this will be
    the <code>tutorial:host</code> module:
<pre class="code sterling">
Module tutorial:host
</pre>
    This name will be used to identify this module for other modules
    to build on it, adding to its definitions.
  </p>

  <h3>Defining Syntax</h3>
  <p>
    We start by defining our abstract syntax:
<pre class="code sterling">
tm ::= var(string)
     | abs(string, tm)
     | app(tm, tm)
</pre>
    This defines one syntactic category, <code>tm</code>, with three
    constructors:
    <ul>
      <li> The <code>var</code> constructor represents lambda calculus
        variables.  We use the Sterling built-in <code>string</code>
        type for variable names.
      <li> The <code>abs</code> constructor represents lambda calculus
        abstractions.  This uses the Sterling <code>string</code> type
        for the bound variable and the <code>tm</code> type for lambda
        calculus terms for the body.
      <li> The <code>app</code> constructor represents the application
        of one term to another.
    </ul>
    These are the only constructors we introduce in the host language,
    although extensions may add to them.
  </p>

  <p>
    For each syntactic category we introduce, we must also give its
    projection type:
<pre class="code sterling">
Projection tm :
</pre>
    Each constructor of a syntactic category introduced by an
    extension will introduce a projection of terms built by that
    constructor.  These projections can then be used to define
    relations extensions introduce for constructs from other
    extensions, as we shall see below.
  </p>

  <p>
    The empty projection type we have for <code>tm</code> means the
    projection will relation two terms of type <code>tm</code>.  In
    some cases, it is useful to condition the projection on other
    arguments.  For example, we might want to be able to condition the
    projection on the object-level types of sub-terms.  In that case,
    we would want a projection type with a typing context so we could
    determine the types of sub-terms in the rules for projection.
  </p>

  <h3>Defining Relations</h3>
  <p>
    We start by defining a relation checking whether a <code>tm</code>
    is closed.  We first declare it:
<pre class="code sterling">
<span class="comment">/*whether a tm is closed, that it does not use any free vars*/</span>
Judgment closed : [string] tm*
</pre>
    This declares a relation named <code>closed</code> with two
    arguments, a list of strings and a <code>tm</code>.  Additionally,
    the <code>tm</code> is marked as the <em>primary component</em> of
    the relation.  Conceptually, the primary component is the argument
    the relation is <em>about</em>.  Here the <code>closed</code>
    relation is <em>about</em> the <code>tm</code>, with the list of
    variable names being present only to support determining something
    about the <code>tm</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will use the primary component to ensure the semantics of
    relations for known constructs are not changed by extensions.
    When an extension introduces a rule defining a relation introduced
    by a built-on module, the primary component must be built by a
    constructor introduced by that extension.  This prevents
    extensions from introducing rules applicable to pre-existing
    constructs and modifying their semantics.
  </p>

  <p>
    We write rules for the relation, which are as one would expect:
<pre class="code sterling">
mem X Vars
------------------ [C-Var]
closed Vars var(X)


closed X::Vars T
--------------------- [C-Abs]
closed Vars abs(X, T)


closed Vars T1
closed Vars T2
----------------------- [C-App]
closed Vars app(T1, T2)
</pre>
    In the <code>C-Var</code> rule we check whether the
    variable <code>X</code> is in the list of bound variables.  This
    uses the <code>mem</code> relation in the Sterling standard
    library rather than a relation defined in this module.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also define evaluation for <code>tm</code>s, with several
    relations to support it:
<pre class="code sterling">
<span class="comment">/*eval T1 T2:  small-step evaluation, where T1 steps to T2*/</span>
Judgment eval : tm* tm

<span class="comment">/*subst X R B S:  substitute R for X in B yielding S*/</span>
Judgment subst : string tm tm* tm

<span class="comment">/*value T:  T is a value*/</span>
Judgment value : tm*
</pre>
    These relations have rules generally as we would expect:
<pre class="code sterling">
X != Y
----------------------- [S-Var-NEq]
subst X R var(Y) var(Y)


------------------ [S-Var-Eq]
subst X R var(X) R


X != Y
subst X R B S
----------------------------- [S-Abs-NEq]
subst X R abs(Y, B) abs(Y, S)


----------------------------- [S-Abs-Eq]
subst X R abs(X, B) abs(X, B)


subst X R T1 S1
subst X R T2 S2
--------------------------------- [S-App]
subst X R app(T1, T2) app(S1, S2)



--------------- [V-Abs]
value abs(X, T)



eval T1 T11
----------------------------- [E-App-Step1]
eval app(T1, T2) app(T11, T2)


value T1
eval T2 T21
----------------------------- [E-App-Step2]
eval app(T1, T2) app(T1, T21)


absForm T1 X Body
value T2
subst X T2 Body V
------------------ [E-App-Subst]
eval app(T1, T2) V
</pre>
    The exception is the <code>E-App-Subst</code> rule.  We would
    expect this rule to have as its conclusion <code>eval app(abs(X,
    Body), T2) V</code>, explicitly stating the first term is an
    abstraction.  The reason we do not write this is that it prevents
    extensions from introducing new abstract-like constructs that may
    be applied.  An extension cannot introduce a new rule defining
    evaluation for <code>app</code> because of the restrictions for
    the primary component, so, if we want to allow <code>app</code> to
    apply extension-introduced function constructors, we cannot put
    the <code>abs</code> form into the rule directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    To solve the problem of extensibility while still getting the
    information we need, we define a relation <code>absForm</code>
    that checks if a <code>tm</code> is
    somehow <code>abs</code>-shaped, pulling out the bound variable
    name and body if so:
<pre class="code sterling">
<span class="comment">/*absForm T X B:  T is like the abstraction abs(X, T)*/</span>
Judgment absForm : tm* string tm

--------------------- [AF-Abs]
absForm abs(X, T) X T
</pre>
    This relation can be extended by extensions so their constructs
    can also be applied using <code>app</code>.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="section" id="letExtension">
  <h2>Let Extension</h2>
  <p>
    Some extensions only add new constructors and define existing
    judgments over them.  This extension adds a new <code>let</code>
    constructor and defines the host language's judgments on it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The extension declares its name and that it builds on the host
    language:
<pre class="code sterling">
Module tutorial:let

Builds on tutorial:host
</pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    This adds one new constructor of the <code>tm</code> category:
<pre class="code sterling">
tm ::= ...
     | let(string, tm, tm)
</pre>
    We start the constructor declaration with an ellipsis
    (<code>...</code>) to show this is an addition to the pre-existing
    constructors of <code>tm</code> rather than a new <code>tm</code>
    category.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because <code>let</code> builds a syntactic category from a
    built-on module, we need to give it a projection that eliminates
    the <code>let</code> constructor:
<pre class="code sterling">

--------------------------------------------- [Proj-Let]
|{tm}- let(X, T1, T2) ~~> app(abs(X, T2), T1)
</pre>
    This says a term built by the <code>let</code> constructor is
    similar to an application of a built abstraction over the same
    sub-terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also define the host language's relations for the
    new <code>let</code> constructor:
<pre class="code sterling">
eval T1 T11
----------------------------------- [E-Let-Step]
eval let(X, T1, T2) let(X, T11, T2)


value T1
subst X T1 T2 V
--------------------- [E-Let-Subst]
eval let(X, T1, T2) V



X != Y
subst X R T1 S1
subst X R T2 S2
--------------------------------------- [S-Let-NEq]
subst X R let(Y, T1, T2) let(Y, S1, S2)


subst X R T1 S1
--------------------------------------- [S-Let-Eq]
subst X R let(X, T1, T2) let(X, S1, T2)



closed Vars T1
closed X::Vars T2
-------------------------- [C-Let]
closed Vars let(X, T1, T2)
</pre>
    Note that each rule has a term built by the <code>let</code>
    constructor as the primary component in the conclusion.  Each new
    rule introduced in an extension for a relation introduced by a
    built-on module must have the primary component built by a
    constructor introduced by the extension so the semantics of
    constructs not introduced by the extension are not affected by the
    extension's new rules.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="section" id="typingExtension">
  <h2>Typing Extension</h2>
  <p>
    Extensions may also introduce new syntactic categories and new
    judgments.  This extension introduces a notion of typing for the
    language.
  </p>

  <p>
    As in all extensions, we declare the module name and the module on
    which it builds:
<pre class="code sterling">
Module tutorial:typing

Builds on tutorial:host
</pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    Because we will be typing <code>tm</code>s, we need a way to
    describe types.  We introduce a new syntactic
    category <code>ty</code>:
<pre class="code sterling">
ty ::= baseTy
     | arrowTy(ty, ty)

Projection ty :
</pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    We also add a typed version of an abstraction, projecting to a
    basic abstraction (<code>abs</code>) and define the host
    language's judgments on it:
<pre class="code sterling">
tm ::= ...
     | tyAbs(string, ty, tm)

------------------------------------ [Proj-TyAbs]
|{tm}- tyAbs(X, Ty, T) ~~> abs(X, T)



X != Y
subst X R B S
----------------------------------------- [S-TyAbs-NEq]
subst X R tyAbs(Y, Ty, B) tyAbs(Y, Ty, S)


----------------------------------------- [S-TyAbs-Eq]
subst X R tyAbs(X, Ty, B) tyAbs(X, Ty, B)



--------------------- [V-TyAbs]
value tyAbs(X, Ty, T)



--------------------------- [AF-TyAbs]
absForm tyAbs(X, Ty, T) X T



closed X::Vars T
--------------------------- [C-TyAbs]
closed Vars tyAbs(X, Ty, T)
</pre>
    Note that rule <code>AF-TyAbs</code> takes a <code>tyAbs</code>
    apart as an abstraction so <code>app(tyAbs("x", var("x")),
    ...)</code> can evaluate.
  </p>

  <p>
    We introduce a judgment <code>typeOf</code> for
    typing <code>tm</code>s:
<pre class="code sterling">
Judgment typeOf : [(string, ty)] tm* ty
</pre>
    We define typing rules for all known constructs, those introduced
    by the typing extension and the host language:
<pre class="code sterling">
lookup G X Ty
------------------ [T-Var]
typeOf G var(X) Ty


typeOf G T1 arrowTy(Ty1, Ty2)
typeOf G T2 Ty1
----------------------------- [T-App]
typeOf G app(T1, T2) Ty2


typeOf (X, Ty1)::G T Ty2
------------------------------------------- [T-TyAbs]
typeOf G tyAbs(X, Ty1, T) arrowTy(Ty1, Ty2)


typeOf (X, Ty1)::G T Ty2
------------------------------------ [T-Abs]
typeOf G abs(X, T) arrowTy(Ty1, Ty2)
</pre>
    Note that in the <code>T-Abs</code> rule we use a meta-variable
    for the argument type.  This gives us the same semantics
    as <code>T-TyAbs</code> in that the function must have exactly one
    type when used, but a program's writer does not need to specify
    what that type is.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we left the description of the <code>typeOf</code> relation at
    this point, it would work in the context of the host language and
    typing extension.  However, if we included the <code>let</code>
    extension in the language composition, typing would not be defined
    for it.  Thus we include a special rule, marked
    with <code>*</code> after the rule name, to define the relation
    for terms built by constructors from other extensions that do not
    build on the current one:
<pre class="code sterling">
|{tm}- T ~~> T_T
typeOf G T_T Ty
---------------- [T-D]*
typeOf G T Ty
</pre>
    For example, this rule would be instantiated for
    the <code>let</code> extension's <code>let</code> constructor,
    defining its typing by the typing of its projection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each relation introduced by an extension with a primary component
    introduced by one of the modules on which it builds must include a
    single default rule.  Often this takes the form seen
    in <code>T-D</code>, where the other arguments to the relation
    are copied directly from the projection of the primary component.
    However, this form is not required, and default rules may take any
    form.  The only requirement is that the primary component in the
    conclusion must be a meta-variable, as it will be filled with
    constructors from other extensions.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="section" id="numExtension">
  <h2>Number Extension</h2>
  <p>
    Extensions can also build on other extensions.  We add an
    extension introducing numbers, building on top of
    the <code>typing</code> extension.
  </p>

  <p>
    We declare the module's name and that it builds on
    the <code>typing</code> extension:
<pre class="code sterling">
Module tutorial:num

Builds on tutorial:typing
</pre>
    This single <code>Builds on</code> declaration will transitively
    include the modules on which <code>tutorial:typing</code> builds,
    so the current extension knows both the <code>typing</code>
    extension and the host language.
  </p>

  <p>
    We extend both <code>tm</code> from the host language
    and <code>ty</code> from the <code>typing</code> extension, giving
    projections for the new constructors from both:
<pre class="code sterling">
tm ::= ...
     | num(int)
     | plus(tm, tm)

ty ::= ...
     | intTy

---------------------------------------------------------- [Proj-IntTy]
|{ty}- intTy ~~> arrowTy(arrowTy(Ty, Ty), arrowTy(Ty, Ty))


---------------------------------------------------------- [Proj-Plus]
|{tm}- plus(T1, T2) ~~>
       abs("m", abs("n", abs("f", abs("x",
          app(var("m"), app(var("f"),
              app(var("n"), app(var("f"), var("x")))))))))


buildNumTerm I T
--------------------------------------- [Proj-Num]
|{tm}- num(I) ~~> abs("f", abs("x", T))
</pre>
    The <code>[Proj-Num]</code> rule uses another relation to build
    the appropriate Church encoding for its number:
<pre class="code sterling">
<span class="comment">/*Build the body of a Church encoding of a number,
  using names "f" and "x"*/</span>
Fixed Judgment buildNumTerm : int tm

======================= [BNT-Zero]
buildNumTerm 0 var("x")


N - 1 = NSub
buildNumTerm NSub T
=============================== [BNT-Step]
buildNumTerm N app(var("f"), T)
</pre>
    Unlike the other relations we have seen, this is a <em>fixed</em>
    judgment.  It is not extensible; all its rules are given by the
    module introducing it.  Because it is not extensible, it does not
    have a primary component.  Fixed judgments are useful for defining
    relations over non-extensible types, such as lists, or to tie
    together multiple extensible relations into a single relation that
    uses them all.  To remind the writer that the relation being
    defined is fixed rather than extensible, the rules use a line made
    from equals signs rather than hyphens.
  </p>

  <p>
    The extension defines the relations introduced by both the host
    language and the <code>typing</code> extension for the constructs
    it introduces:
<pre class="code sterling">
eval T1 T11
------------------------------- [E-Plus-Step1]
eval plus(T1, T2) plus(T11, T2)


value T1
eval T2 T21
------------------------------- [E-Plus-Step2]
eval plus(T1, T2) plus(T1, T21)


I1 + I2 = I
---------------------------------- [E-Plus-Add]
eval plus(num(I1), num(I2)) num(I)



----------------------- [S-Num]
subst X R num(I) num(I)


subst X R T1 S1
subst X R T2 S2
----------------------------------- [S-Plus]
subst X R plus(T1, T2) plus(S1, S2)



------------ [V-Num]
value num(I)



------------------ [C-Num]
closed Vars num(I)


closed Vars T1
closed Vars T2
------------------------ [C-Plus]
closed Vars plus(T1, T2)



--------------------- [T-Num]
typeOf G num(I) intTy


typeOf G T1 intTy
typeOf G T2 intTy
--------------------------- [T-Plus]
typeOf G plus(T1, T2) intTy
</pre>
    The restrictions on extending the relations are the same whether
    the relation was introduced by the host language or
    the <code>typing</code> extension.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the projection of <code>plus</code> will not evaluate
    with the rules above because it relies on the Church encoding of
    numbers, that is, the projection of <code>num(I)</code>.  If we
    believe it is important the projection capture evaluation
    behavior, we can add a rule for <code>absForm</code>
    for <code>num</code> capturing its Church encoding:
<pre class="code sterling">
buildNumTerm I T
------------------------------ [AF-Num]
absForm num(I) "f" abs("x", T)
</pre>
    This rule will also have the effect of making <code>app(num(3),
    ...)</code> evaluable.  Strange as this may seem, the extension
    writer can decide it is fine, especially in light of building on
    the <code>typing</code> extension that will rule out such a term
    as ill-typed.
