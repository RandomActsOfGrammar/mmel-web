    <h1>Extensible Languages</h1>
  </a>
  <p>
    In general, extensible programming languages are languages where
    portions of them are developed separately, then put together.  The
    specific view of extensible languages we take is one in which the
    language's syntax and semantics are given by a set of
    independently-developed modules building on each other.  A common
    form for this to take is one where one
    module is the host language and the other modules are extensions
    adding to it.  A language is built by choosing some subset of
    these modules, creating a language with all the constructs and
    semantics of all included modules.
  </p>

  <p>
    While we are not tied to the host-and-extensions model, we will
    often use it, and in particular will use the term "extension" to
    refer to any module building on another, to highlight the fact
    it <i>extends</i> the other.  We occasionally also use "host" to
    refer to modules not building on others.  Also, most of our
    examples will use a direct host-and-extensions structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    This view of extensibility is not
    new.  Some examples of previous work using the host-and-extensions
    model:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://jastadd.cs.lth.se/">JastAdd</a> is a Java
        compiler that permits adding extensions to Java.
      <li> <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-marburg.de/~seba/projects/sugarj/">SugarJ</a>
        adds new syntax to Java by permitting libraries to export new
        syntax in addition to functions.
      <li> <a href="https://melt.cs.umn.edu/silver">Silver</a> is an
        attribute grammar system for writing extensible languages, and
        is an extensible language itself.
      <li> <a href="https://melt.cs.umn.edu/ableC">AbleC</a> is an
        extensible version of the C programming language.
    </ul>
    Our view is slightly different from that of the first two in that
    extensions may add both new syntax and semantics, with language
    composition also not requiring glue code; any composed language
    includes the semantics of all modules included in it, and these
    semantics are defined without the language composer needing to add
    any more definitions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previous work has addressed frameworks for guaranteed composition
    of extensible languages.  One aspect is
    <a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/95605">parsing
      extensible languages</a>, guaranteeing the descriptions of
    concrete syntax for extensible languages given in the context of
    independent modules will produce a non-ambiguous parser in any
    composition if they passed a modular check.  Another aspect is
    <a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/188954">well-definedness
      of semantic descriptions</a> for extensible languages written in
    attribute grammars, guaranteeing the language semantics are
    fully-defined and not missing equations without the person
    building the composed language needing to write any glue code to
    fill in missing equations.  Our work in general seeks to give
    guarantees for the <i>correctness of the semantics</i> of
    composed languages as another aspect of guaranteed composition.

  <h2>Basic Extensible Languages</h2>
  <p>
    In a basic formulation of language extensibility, a host language
    can introduce the following:
    <ul>
      <li> Syntactic categories
      <li> Constructors building those syntactic categories
      <li> Semantic relations
      <li> Rules defining those semantic relations
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Extension modules can build on the definitions given by the
    modules on which they build by introducing the following:
    <ul>
      <li> New constructors of imported syntactic categories
      <li> New rules defining imported relations
      <li> New syntactic categories
      <li> Constructors building those new syntactic categories
      <li> New semantic relations
      <li> Rules defining those new semantic relations
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    A composed language is built by combining a set of modules.  A
    well-formed composition requires, for each module included, that
    the modules on which it builds are also included.  For example, if
    module <code>A</code> builds on modules <code>B</code>
    and <code>C</code>, a language composition
    including <code>A</code> must also include <code>B</code>
    and <code>C</code>.  A composed language contains all the syntax
    and semantics introduced by all modules included in it.
  </p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Composing New Syntax and New Semantics</h2>
  <p>
    Notice that we have independent extension on two fronts, in both
    the syntax and semantics of our language.  How, when one extension
    adds a new semantic relation, do we define it on the new syntax
    constructors introduced by another extension?  This is part of
    Phil Wadler's famous <em>expression problem</em>.  One option is
    to say the relation is not derivable on the new constructors.
    However, this would make the combination of new syntax and new
    semantic relations unusable in practice.  New relations, such as a
    new static safety check, would never hold if a program included
    new syntax from a different extension, and thus we would need to
    choose between the safety check and the other new syntax.
  </p>

  <p>
    The solution we use allows a new relation from one
    extension to be defined on new syntax from another extension.
    This solution relies on the notion of the <em>primary
    component</em> of a relation, given when the relation is declared.
    The primary component is the argument the relation
    is <em>about</em>.  For example, a typing relation
    is <em>about</em> the expression being typed, with the typing
    context and type being secondary, only telling us something about
    the expression.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each relation introduced by an extension where the primary
    component is a syntactic category given by the base language is
    given a special rule, called its <em>default rule</em>, to define
    it on new syntax from other extensions.  This rule is written with
    a variable in the place of the primary component.  For example, we
    might have an <code>optimize</code> relation reducing constant
    computations in an expression, with the default rule stating
    optimizing an unknown expression leaves it as it
    is:  <code>optimize E E</code> (a safe, if uninspiring, choice).
    When a composed language is built, combining several extensions,
    the default rule is replicated for each new constructor from other
    extensions, filling in the primary component with the new
    constructor.  For example, if other extensions introduced
    constructors <code>add3(expr, expr, expr)</code>
    and <code>negate(expr)</code>, we would instantiate the default
    rule for each of these
    (using <a href="sterling/index.html">Sterling</a> syntax):
    <pre class="code sterling">

------------------------------------------
optimize add3(E1, E2, E3) add3(E1, E2, E3)

----------------------------
optimize negate(E) negate(E) </pre>
    This gives the <code>optimize</code> relation a definition on any
    syntax, even that not known to it when it was introduced.
  </p>

  <p>
    Oftentimes a simple default rule, as we saw
    with <code>optimize</code>, is not sufficient for defining an
    extension-introduced relation.  Generally what we want is to use a
    notion of projection of an unknown construct to a known one.
    Each syntactic category given has a projection relation, and each
    constructor an extension introduces building an imported syntactic
    category must have a rule giving its projection.  Then the
    default rule for a relation can be written to find the projection
    of the primary component and derive the relation on this
    projection, oftentimes something like this (once again, in
    <a href="sterling/index.html">Sterling</a> syntax):
    <pre class="code sterling">
|{ty}- X ~~> XT
rel A B XT C D
--------------- [Rel-D]*
rel A B X C D </pre>
    This essentially copies the definition from the projection, and
    allows more interesting relations to be defined in extensions.

  <h2>Limitations on Extending Relations</h2>
  <p>
    Defining new semantic relations in an extension relies on
    understanding the semantics of existing constructs.  For example,
    writing the <code>optimize</code> relation given above to reduce
    constant computations such as <code>3 + 4</code> only works if we
    know that <code>3 + 4</code> must always reduce to <code>7</code>.
    If an extension could write a new rule for evaluation
    allowing <code>3 + 4</code> to evaluate instead to another number,
    or a different kind of value entirely, the optimization would no
    longer accurately capture the language's semantics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, proving properties in the context of extensible
    languages relies on understanding the semantics of existing
    constructs.  In proving the <code>optimize</code> relation given
    above is correct, that the optimized expression evaluates to the
    same value as the original expression, requires knowing constant
    expressions such as <code>3 + 4</code> must reduce according to
    the known rules.  If an extension could write a new rule for
    evaluation allowing <code>3 + 4</code> to evaluate instead to a
    value other than <code>7</code>, we could not prove
    the <code>optimize</code> relation accurately captures the
    language's semantics.
  </p>

  <p>
    To ensure the semantics of the known language remain the same
    under extension, new rules given in an extension defining a
    relation it imports must have the primary component of the
    conclusion be built at the top by a new constructor.  For example,
    the extension adding the <code>add3</code> constructor could
    define evaluation for it, but it could not write a rule defining
    evaluation for the pre-existing addition.
