  <h2>What are Extensible Languages?</h2>
  <p>
    In our view, extensible languages are open libraries of
    independently-developed extensions building on a host language,
    adding to its syntax and semantics.  A language is built by
    choosing a set of extensions.
    See <a href="extensibleLanguages.html">this document</a> for more
    information on our view of extensible languages.

  <h2>What is Modular Metatheory?</h2>
  <p>
    Metatheory is the set of properties known to be true of a
    programming language.  A common example is <i>type
    preservation</i>, that expressions evaluate to values of the same
    type (e.g. an expression of type <code>int</code> will evaluate to
    a value of type <code>int</code>), guaranteeing type errors do not
    arise when a well-typed program runs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modular metatheory permits the host language and extensions to it
    to introduce metatheoretic properties independently of one
    another and prove them modularly such that each property is
    guaranteed to hold for any composed language containing the module
    introducing the property.  The proofs as well as the properties
    are carried out by modules independently, with each module writing
    its proofs without knowledge of other extensions in the library.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Our approach to modular metatheory is based on two ideas:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Decomposing proofs</span>:  Proofs
        are broken down on the boundaries between language modules,
        and the responsibility for writing them distributed.
      <li><span class="highlight">Generic reasoning</span>:  When the
        proof pieces cannot be distributed, we reason generically
        about unknown extensions based on broad constraints imposed on
        their behavior.
    </ul>
    We demonstrate the soundness of this approach by using the
    modular proofs written using the above ideas to construct proofs
    automatically for any composed language.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach is detailed in our
    paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14374">"A Modular
    Approach to Metatheoretic Reasoning for Extensible Languages"</a>.
