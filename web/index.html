  <h2>What are Extensible Languages?</h2>
  <p>
    In general, extensible programming languages are languages where
    portions of them are developed separately, then put together.  In
    our view, extensible languages are specifically built by a host
    language and independently-developed extensions.  The host
    language provides core functionality, defining basic constructs
    and semantic relations, such as typing and evaluation.  Extensions
    add to this by introducing new constructs and new semantic
    relations.  A language is built from these pieces by choosing a
    set of extensions to add to the host language, creating a language
    with all the constructs and semantics of the host language and all
    included extensions.  See <a href="extensibleLanguages.html">this
      document</a> for more information on our view of extensible
    languages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previous work has addressed giving guarantees for compositions of
    extensible languages.  One aspect is
    <a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/95605">parsing
      extensible languages</a>, guaranteeing the descriptions of
    concrete syntax for extensible languages given in the context of
    independent modules will produce a non-ambiguous parser in any
    composition if they passed a modular check.  Another aspect is
    <a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/188954">well-definedness
      of semantic descriptions</a> for extensible languages written in
    attribute grammars, guaranteeing the language semantics are
    fully-defined and not missing equations without the person
    building the composed language needing to write any glue code to
    fill in missing equations.  In this work, we want to give
    guarantees for the <i>correctness</i> of the semantics of composed
    languages.

  <h2>What is Modular Metatheory?</h2>
  <p>
    Metatheory is the set of properties known to be true of a
    programming language.  A common example is <i>type
    preservation</i>, that expressions evaluate to values of the same
    type (e.g. an expression of type <tt>int</tt> will evaluate to a
    value of type <tt>int</tt>), guaranteeing type errors are not
    encountered when a well-typed program runs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modular metatheory is proving properties of extensible languages
    in such a way that the proofs can be written in the context of the
    parts known by individual modules, the host language or an
    extension with the host language, such that we know each property
    will hold for any composed language knowing the modules.
  </p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Our Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Our overarching goal is to provide guarantees for the semantic
    correctness of extensible languages, where the correctness is
    determined by adherence to properties introduced by the modules in
    the language.  Our goals:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Properties introduced by the host
          language can be given modular proofs guaranteeing they will
          hold for any composed language.</span>  The modular proofs
        here can be distributed, since the host language and each
        extension will know these properties exist.
      <li><span class="highlight">Properties introduced by extensions
          can be given modular proofs <i>by the extension alone</i>
          guaranteeing they will hold for any composed
          language.</span>  The proof must be written by the extension
        itself because other extensions do not know the property
        exists to help prove it.
    </ul>
    The difficulty in this is that modular proofs are written in a
    limited context, the host language or the host language with one
    extension, but are intended to apply in larger contexts.
