  <h2>What are Extensible Languages?</h2>
  <p>
    In our view, extensible languages are open libraries of
    independently-developed extensions building on a host language,
    adding to its syntax and semantics.  A language is built by
    choosing a set of extensions.
    See <a href="extensibleLanguages.html">this document</a> for more
    information on our view of extensible languages.

  <h2>What is Modular Metatheory?</h2>
  <p>
    Metatheory is the set of properties known to be true of a
    programming language.  A common example is <i>type
    preservation</i>, that expressions evaluate to values of the same
    type (e.g. an expression of type <tt>int</tt> will evaluate to a
    value of type <tt>int</tt>), guaranteeing type errors do not
    arise when a well-typed program runs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modular metatheory is proving properties by reasoning
    independently in the context of each module, where properties may
    be introduced by the host language or an extension, such that we
    know each property will hold for any composed language.

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Our approach is to modular metatheory is based on two ideas:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Decomposing proofs</span>:  Proofs
        are broken down on the boundaries between language modules,
        and the responsibility for writing them distributed.
      <li><span class="highlight">Generic reasoning</span>:  When the
        proof pieces cannot be distributed, we reason generically
        about unknown extensions based on broad constraints imposed on
        their behavior.
    </ul>
    We can establish the soundness of this approach by using the
    modular proofs written with the above ideas to construct proofs
    automatically for any composed language.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach is detailed
    in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14374">"A Modular Approach
      to Metatheoretic Reasoning for Extensible Languages"</a>.
