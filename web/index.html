  <h2>What are Extensible Languages?</h2>
  <p>
    In our view, extensible languages are open libraries of
    independently-developed extensions building on a host language,
    adding to its syntax and semantics.  A language is built by
    choosing a set of extensions.
    See <a href="extensibleLanguages.html">this document</a> for more
    information on our view of extensible languages.

  <h2>What is Modular Metatheory?</h2>
  <p>
    Metatheory is the set of properties known to be true of a
    programming language.  A common example is <i>type
    preservation</i>, that expressions evaluate to values of the same
    type (e.g. an expression of type <tt>int</tt> will evaluate to a
    value of type <tt>int</tt>), guaranteeing type errors are not
    encountered when a well-typed program runs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modular metatheory is proving properties by reasoning
    independently in the context of each module, where properties may
    be introduced by the host language or an extension, such that we
    know each property will hold for any composed language.

  <h2>Our Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Our overarching goal is to provide guarantees for the semantic
    correctness of extensible languages, where the correctness is
    determined by adherence to properties introduced by the modules in
    the language.  Our goals:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Properties introduced by the host
          language can be given modular proofs guaranteeing they will
          hold for any composed language.</span>  The modular proofs
        here can be distributed, since the host language and each
        extension will know these properties exist.
      <li><span class="highlight">Properties introduced by extensions
          can be given modular proofs <i>by the extension alone</i>
          guaranteeing they will hold for any composed
          language.</span>  The proof must be written by the extension
        itself because other extensions do not know the property
        exists to help prove it.
    </ul>
    The difficulty in this is that modular proofs are written in a
    limited context, the host language or the host language with one
    extension, but are intended to apply in larger contexts.
